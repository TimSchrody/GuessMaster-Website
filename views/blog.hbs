            Guess What? Hello World! üåç</h1>
          <p>GuessMaster is all about fun. ü§© Fun getting to know each other and
            getting together, fun playing and competing.
            <br /><br />
            Our project simply can't do without fun and we want to design our
            blog accordingly.
            <br /><br />
            We've found that all the work we do in the home office makes it
            difficult to "really" get to know our colleagues. Among the
            students, we got together and exchanged ideas over relaxed
            mini-games, which also allowed us to get to know each other
            privately. The minigames encouraged us to exchange ideas.
            <br />
            We would now like to contribute to this ourselves by creating a
            web-based mini-game. Various questions are to be answered and the
            players receive points depending on their answers.
            <br />
            We will probably implement the project with Unity in C#. The game
            server will initially be hosted by photon (photonengine.com).
            <br /><br />
            Our team consists of:
            <ul>
              Tim G.: Backend-Dev
              <br />
              Tim S.: Backend-Dev
              <br />
              Marius M.: Product-Owner, Dev-Support
              <br />
              Daniel S.: Frontend-Dev
              <br />
              Daniel K.: Scrum-Master, Frontend-Dev
            </ul>
            <br />
            We work in weekly sprints and record our tasks in Azure DevOps. In
            addition to review, retro and planning, we want to exchange the
            current status twice a week in dailies.
            <br /><br /><br />
            P.S. For the sake of necessity, we attach a picture from the
            backlog.

            Still Guessing...</h1>
          <p>
            Yep, we're still guessing. While we're not 100% sure about all the
            functionalities we'll include in our GuessMaster Webgame, we can
            tell you this: It'll be a fun minigame!
            <br />
            Starting from our landing page our players will have to add their
            name (or alias) and can then choose from one of three options. When
            clicking on "Quick Game" they either join an ongoing public game or
            a public lobby with predefined settings will be opened. Joining a
            private game for guessing with e.g. friends or colleagues is easy,
            all you need to know is a code, enter it in the textbox and click on
            "Join now". If a player wants to create a lobby with custom
            settings, he/she can do so by simply clicking on the corresponding
            button. The player will then have some options, including the
            possibility to choose between a public or private game.
            <br />
            We'll continue explaining one of the other Mockups in our next blog
            entry.
            <br /><br />
            In the past weeks we also used our time to get to know our tool of
            choice, unity. Each of us started off with a tutorial and then
            continued developing a simple something in Unity.
            <br />
            In our ongoing sprint we created and refined our Use Case and
            finished our first Mockups. You'll find a Mockup of our landingpage
            down below.

            Less Guessing, more clarity.</h1>
          <p>
            This week we managed to gain some clarity about the background
            processes that we will need by creating our activity diagrams and
            Use-Case-Realization Specifications. We hope they are
            self-explanatory and kindly ask you to comment any upcoming question
            so we can then improve those in the future. You can find them all on
            our Github in the "docs" folder or one example of each in the
            following pictures. (Link below. They're linked at 3.1.x of our SRS
            or on those sub pages.) Based on that knowledge we started coding
            some small pieces.

            We promised to explain our mockups in our blog, so here we go:
            <br />
            In this blog we'll take a look at our "settings". This page's
            purpose solely lies in giving our users the possibility to create
            games with their preferred settings.
            <br />
            In our settings-menu the user can change the gamemode, total rounds
            played, player capacity of the lobby and the maximum allowed time
            for guessing the answers to our questions. We plan to implement
            these options as drop-down-menus. Additionally, the user can also
            choose to create the lobby as a public lobby or to be only
            accessible with a code (private game). All options will be filled
            with default values at the beginning.
            <br />
            After selecting the desired settings, the lobby can be created via
            "Create Lobby". The user can also leave the settings at any time and
            return to our gamemode selection.
            <br /><br />

            Time for another Update</h1>
          <p>
            This week we finished our class diagram (attached below) and made
            some small adjustments to our sequence diagrams. The adjustments
            were so minor that it wouldn't justify displaying them here, so
            please go check them out at our GitHub if you're interested in those
            details.
            <br />
            We used the OCP (Open-Closed Principle) for our design as it is the
            most fitting one for a game as it is open for additions while not
            allowing changes in the "running" program.
            <br />
            Our most important class is the "LobbyController" because of its
            necessity for joining and creating a game. It is also worth
            mentioning that none of the classes is completely finished as of now
            because we're not absolutely sure about all the functions we
            require.

            <br /><br />
            Let's continue with a quick look at one of our mockups: The Lobby.
            <br />
            On the picture below you can see the mockup from a player's view.
            It's simple and straight forward while showing all the details you
            need to know. In the center we plan to show our Logo and the
            gamecode below, so you can always tell your friends in which lobby
            they need to join to be able to guess with you. A list of all
            players, led by the lobby's creator is shown beneath. The left-hand
            side shows all the important information about your chosen settings.
            Additionally, a short description of your gamemode is available on
            the right-hand side. While "normal" players can only see one button
            in the bottom left corner to leave the lobby, the creator will have
            a second button to start the game.
            <br /><br />

          <h1><span style="color:rgb(173, 11, 11);">Week 5:</span>
            It begins to look a lot like... something</h1>
          <p>
            The heading has been program this week.
            <br />
            Our backend and frontend have gotten a lot better within this week.
            <br />
            We now have a running demo which includes all steps from our
            homescreen to playing the game. That includes creating a game,
            joining a game (by code), gameroom ("lobby") and the game itself
            (question-answering, "Guessing").
            <br />
            That means: it is possible for players to create a game and for
            others to join that game. The creator can start the game and
            exemplary questions can be answered. So basically, our
            core-functionalitites are working. üéâ
            <br />
            However, we still have quite some work to do. For example we need to
            add options and some scenes as well as more questions.
            <br /><br />
            As planned, Tim G. worked on the backend together with Tim S. and
            Marius M. They programmed the options to create a game (with
            standard settings) and for others to join the same gameroom. They
            also researched options to automatically add fitting questions.
            Daniel S. and Daniel K. started off with the frontend of our
            gameroom. You can find previews of our gameroom below.
            <br /><br />
            (Because we developed a majority of our frontend of the gameroom, we
            will not explain that mockup in our blog.)
